                        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, 
                        to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, 
                        or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to 
                        your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, 
                        and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.

                        <b><a href="#">CSS</a></b> (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? 
                        This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.
                    </p>

                        In the <a href="#">Introduction to HTML</a> module we covered what HTML is, and how it is used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable 
                        in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. 
                        Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing is the browser's default styles — very 
                        basic styles that the browser applies to HTML to make sure it will be basically readable even if no explicit styling is specified by 
                        the author of the page.

                    <p>
                        As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A <b>document</b> is usually a text file structured using a markup language — <a href="#">HTML</a> is the most common markup language, but you 
                        may also come across other markup languages such as <a href="#">SVG</a> or <a href="#">XML</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Presenting</b> a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. <a href="#">Browsers</a>, 
                        like <a href="#">Firefox</a>, <a href="#">Chrome</a>, or <a href="#">Edge</a>, are designed to present documents visually, 
                        for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="note" id="note">
                        <b>Note:</b> A browser is sometimes called a <a href="#">user agent</a>, which basically means a computer program that represents a person inside 
                        a computer system. Browsers are the main type of user agent we think of when talking about CSS, however, it is not the only one. 
                        There are other user agents available — such as those which convert HTML and CSS documents into PDFs to be printed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the <a href="#">color</a> and <a href="#">size</a> of headings and links. It can be used to 
                        create layout — for example <a href="#">turning a single column of text into a layout</a> with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. 
                        It can even be used for effects such as <a href="#">animation</a>. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.

                        In this article we will take a simple HTML document and apply CSS to it, 
                        learning some practical things about the language along the way.

                    <p>
                        Our starting point is an HTML document. You can copy the code from below if 
                        you want to work on your own computer. Save the code below as index.html in 
                        a folder on your machine.

                <header>Adding CSS to your document</header>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that 
                        we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different ways 
                        to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, however, 
                        for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking 
                        CSS from the head of your document.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. 
                        The .css extension shows that this is a CSS file.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To link styles.css to index.html add the following line somewhere inside 
                        the <head> of the HTML document:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        h1 {
                            color: red;
                        }
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser. 
                        The level one heading at the top of the document should now be red. If that happens, 
                        congratulations — you have successfully applied some CSS to an HTML document. 
                        If that doesn't happen, carefully check that you've typed everything correctly.

                <article>
                    <p>
                        By making our heading red we have already demonstrated that we can 
                        target and style an HTML element. We do this by targeting an element selector — this is 
                        a selector that directly matches an HTML element name. To target all paragraphs in the 
                        document you would use the selector p. To turn all paragraphs green you would use:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        p {
                            color: green;
                        }
                    </code>
                    <p>Try this out in your CSS document.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>
                        So far we have styled elements based on their HTML element names. 
                        This works as long as you want all of the elements of that type in your document to look the same. 
                        Most of the time that isn't the case and so you will need to find a way to select a subset of the 
                        elements without changing the others. The most common way to do this is to add a class 
                        to your HTML element and target that class.
                    </p>
                    <p>In your HTML document, add a <a href="#">class attribute</a> to the second list item. 
                        Your list will now look like this:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        <pre>
                            &ltul>
                                &ltli>Item one&lt/li>
                                &ltli class="special">Item two&lt/li>
                                &ltli>Item &ltem>three&lt/em>&lt/li>
                            &lt/ul>
                        </pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        In your CSS you can target the class of special by creating a selector that starts 
                        with a full stop character. Add the following to your CSS file:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        .special {
                            color: orange;
                            font-weight: bold;
                        }
